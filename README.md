A little strategy game I'm working on for fun

I'm a student and am creating this little strategy game for fun and to work on my coding. 
I've had this idea for a game for years and now I'm using my new skills to try to make it happen.
It'm designing it to be used with any sort of place or map, but as I work on it I'm using Ireland around the year 1000.
A sort of precursor to Brian Boru, who is at this time just lord of Mumhain (Munster).

This is my oringial work on it as a console based application in C++; I'm now working on making it a GUI-based C# application in Visual Studio, which you'll also find here.
